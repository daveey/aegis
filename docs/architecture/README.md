# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains architecture documentation, design proposals, and major refactoring plans.

## Purpose

These documents capture:
- **Architectural decisions**: Why the system is structured this way
- **Design proposals**: Plans for major changes before implementation
- **Refactoring plans**: Strategies for improving existing code
- **System evolution**: How the architecture has changed over time

## Documents

- `design.md` - Original high-level design document
- `REFACTOR_PLAN.md` - Plans for major code refactoring
- `REFACTOR_COMPLETE.md` - Documentation of completed refactoring

## Related Documentation

For detailed architecture documentation, see:
- [`design/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`](../../design/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) - Complete system architecture
- [`design/ORCHESTRATION.md`](../../design/ORCHESTRATION.md) - Orchestrator design
- [`design/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`](../../design/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md) - Database design
- [`design/TASK_LIST.md`](../../design/TASK_LIST.md) - Roadmap and task breakdown

## Guidelines

When adding architecture documents:
1. **Start with the problem**: What are we trying to solve?
2. **Explore alternatives**: Consider multiple approaches
3. **Document trade-offs**: Why this approach over others?
4. **Include diagrams**: Visual representations help understanding
5. **Link to related docs**: Connect to design docs and implementation
6. **Update main docs**: Ensure design/ folder stays current

**Note**: Active design documents should be in [`design/`](../../design/), not here. This directory is for historical architecture evolution documentation.
